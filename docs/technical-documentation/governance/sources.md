# The sources

The Sources of Governance refer to the various origins or means by which rules are created. Sources of governance are categorized into four main types as recognized by the Axone protocol:

## Protocol Governance

Protocol Governance sets the fundamental rules and regulations governing the Axone blockchain. It is the foundation upon which all other levels are built and provides the core principles and guidelines that dictate how the protocol operates.

## Zone rules

Rules establish the boundaries of a specific area in the dataverse, termed a Zone, within which governance is enforced. Each Zone is governed by its unique set of Rules tailored to its particular function or purpose.

## Resource Consent

Consents are agreements associated with the use of Resources within Zones. By resources, we mean Digital Resources (e.g. datasets) or Services. It goes beyond simple approval and encompasses the permissions and restrictions on resource owners' access, usage, sharing, management and handling of their resources. It allows parties to define boundaries and establish terms for others to interact with their digital resources. It's a crucial aspect of governance, ensuring resources are used appropriately per the relevant parties' expressed will and intentions.

## Agreement

An agreement between parties involves creating shared understanding, consent, and alignment regarding future actions or outcomes. It signifies that the involved parties voluntarily accept and adhere to the rules, obligations, and conditions outlined in the agreement. By doing so, they demonstrate their commitment to collaboration and willingness to respect the rights and responsibilities defined in the contract until its completion.
