# Storage Connector

This section aims to describe how you can build a storage provider connector for the Axone protocol. We will implement here a simple storage proxy using the Axone SDK and expose it over HTTP.

## Functional Specification

The storage proxy will allow the following features:

- `Authentication`: Given an authentication verifiable credential, the proxy will authenticate the identity;
- `Read`: Allow or not read access to a stored resource based on the governance rules of both the storage service & the requested resource;
- `Store`: Allow or not to store a resource based on the governance rules of the storage service, issuing a verifiable credential expressing the publication of the stored resource;

## Proxy implementation

To instantiate the proxy we'll need first some element to provide.

In order to issue credentials verifiable on-chain, the storage service must have a set of keys to provide cryptographic proofs, let's create them:

```go
key, err := keys.NewKeyFromMnemonic(mnemonic)
```

It'll need also to establish a connection with the Axone blockchain to be able to interact with it, let's create a client for that purpose:

```go
dataverseClient, err := dataverse.NewQueryClient(
    context.Background(),
    nodeGrpcAddr, // The gRPC address of an Axone node
    dataverseAddr, // The address of the dataverse smart contract
    grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()), // Use insecure credentials for demo purposes
)
```

For the management of verifiable credentials the proxy will need to resolve JSON-LD contexts, let's create a resolver for that purpose:

```go
documentLoader := ld.NewCachingDocumentLoader( // Let's cache the resolved documents
    ld.NewDefaultDocumentLoader(nil), // The default document loader will fetch documents using an HTTP client
)
```

We now have all the elements to instantiate the proxy:

```go
storageProxy, err := storage.NewProxy(
    ctx,
    key,
    baseURL, // the base URL on which the proxy will be exposed, it'll be used to issue publication credentials
    dataverseClient,
    documentLoader,
    func(ctx context.Context, resourceID string) (io.Reader, error) {
        // Here should lie the logic to retrieve a resource from the storage service.
        // At this point, the proxy has already authenticated and authorize the identity and checked the governance rules.
        // You can implement the read logic with a database, a file system or whatever suits your needs.
    },
    func(ctx context.Context, resourceID string, data io.Reader) error {
        // Here should lie the logic to store a resource in the storage service.
        // At this point, the proxy has already authenticated and authorize the identity and checked the governance rules.
        // You can implement the store logic with a database, a file system or whatever suits your needs.
        // The issuance of the publication credential is handled by the proxy. You do not need to manage that.
    },
)
```

## Expose over HTTP

At this point we have a fully functional storage proxy, but it is not available through any communication protocol, let's expose it over HTTP.

We'll expose an API with three endpoints:

- `POST /authenticate`: Authenticate an identity given a verifiable credential and return a JWT token that must be used to access other endpoints;
- `GET /{resourceID}`: Read a resource given its DID, the JWT token must be provided in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token;
- `POST /{resourceID}`: Store a resource given its DID, the JWT token must be provided in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token;

```go
err := http.NewServer( // The sdk provide a configurable HTTP server
    listenAddr, // The address on which the server will listen (e.g. "0.0.0.0:8080")
    storageProxy.HTTPConfigurator( // the proxy will provide the necessary options to properly configure the server, you can combine them with your own
        jwtSecretKey, // The secret key used to sign the JWT tokens
        jwtDuration, // The duration of the JWT token validity
    ),
).Listen() // Start the server, returning an error if something went wrong
```

## Full source

Until now we saw only separate snippets for pedagogic purpose, let's see what it looks like when we put everything together in a single `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/axone-protocol/axone-sdk/dataverse"
	"github.com/axone-protocol/axone-sdk/http"
	"github.com/axone-protocol/axone-sdk/keys"
	"github.com/axone-protocol/axone-sdk/provider/storage"
	"github.com/piprate/json-gold/ld"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure"
)

func main() {
	mnemonic := os.Args[1]
	nodeGrpcAddr := os.Args[2]
	dataverseAddr := os.Args[3]
	baseURL := os.Args[4]
	listenAddr := os.Args[5]
	jwtSecretKey := []byte(os.Args[6])
	jwtDuration, err := time.ParseDuration(os.Args[7])
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	key, err := keys.NewKeyFromMnemonic(mnemonic)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	dataverseClient, err := dataverse.NewQueryClient(
		context.Background(),
		nodeGrpcAddr,
		dataverseAddr,
		grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	storageProxy, err := storage.NewProxy(
		context.Background(),
		key,
		baseURL,
		dataverseClient,
		ld.NewCachingDocumentLoader(ld.NewDefaultDocumentLoader(nil)),
		func(ctx context.Context, id string) (io.Reader, error) {
			return os.Open("/data/" + id)
		},
		func(ctx context.Context, s string, reader io.Reader) error {
			content, err := io.ReadAll(reader) // Don't do that...
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}

			return os.WriteFile("/data/"+s, content, 0o644)
		},
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	err = http.NewServer(
		listenAddr,
		storageProxy.HTTPConfigurator(jwtSecretKey, jwtDuration),
	).Listen()

	fmt.Println("Server stopped:", err)
}
```

Don't take this implementation as production-grade, it suffers from many issues. It is only a starting point to build your own storage connector.

## Real-world example

As an example, and reference implementation of a complete storage connector, we provide a simple implementation of a connector for an S3 storage service: https://github.com/axone-protocol/s3-auth-proxy.
