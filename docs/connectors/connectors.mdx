# Connectors

This section aims to describe how to connect external resources (e.g. storage service, computation resources) with the Axone protocol.

## Overview

The Axone protocol is designed to be a general-purpose protocol that can be used to connect various resources, we talk about XaaS (i.e. Anything as a Service).

Each resource shall be referenced and described in the protocol through verifiable credential carrying claims aligned with the [Axone Ontology](/architecture/ontology/axone-ontology), along with and their [Governance](/architecture/governance/introduction) rules expressed as Prolog programs.

When multiple resources must interact with each other, they shall be exposed and communicate in a way that allows them to authorize access after verifying:

- The authenticity of their claimed identity;
- The rules under which they're governed allows the requested interactions;

This authentication & authorization is the responsibility of `Connectors`, that will act as authentication & authorization gateways for the resources.

## Axone SDK

To ease the development of connectors, and more generally interact with the Axone protocol in a programmatic way, we provide an [SDK](https://github.com/axone-protocol/axone-sdk) in Golang.

The SDK provides a set of tools covering different aspects of the Axone Architecture:

- `Verifiable Credentials`: issuance, parsing and verification;
- `Dataverse`: Submit claims & retrieve information on resources;
- `Authentication`: Authenticate identities against the Axone protocol;
- `Authorization`: Query resources governance for authorization purposes by evaluating on-chain Prolog rules;
- `Keys`: Helper primitives to manage cryptographic keys, used to sign/verify claims.
- `Proxy`: Provide connectors logic to wire them with the Axone protocol, along with means to expose them through APIs.

To give you an exhaustive idea of the features it offers here is its [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axone-protocol/axone-sdk).
