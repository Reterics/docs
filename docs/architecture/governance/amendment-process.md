# Amendment process

Amending each level of the hierarchy is living and perpetually in flux, reflecting the evolving needs and circumstances of the protocol. The specific procedure for making amendments is unique to each level of the hierarchy and is dictated by the rules and regulations inherent to that level.

## Protocol governance

At the highest level, amendments are often driven by proposals from the community. These proposals, ranging from minor adjustments to significant changes, are submitted to a community vote. If approved, these amendments become part of the protocol's governance, shaping the fundamental rules and guidelines that govern the entire blockchain.

## For zones

Rules can also be amended based on the needs and requirements of the zone. While adhering to the overarching protocol governance, these amendments allow flexibility and adaptability within each zone. The process of making amendments is distinct for each zone, with specific rules outlining the mechanisms by which changes can be enacted. Zones can adopt closed mechanisms that prohibit any rule modifications. Conversely, zones may also choose to uphold democratic principles, allowing rule changes based on user voting within the zone. The flexibility of these mechanisms underscores the adaptability inherent in the governance structure.

## For consents

Consent amendments ensure that resources are used per the relevant parties' current will and intentions. The consent attached to Resources can also be amended. This could be driven by the resource owner's changing preferences or new requirements for using, accessing, or managing the Resource.

## For agreements

Agreements between parties can also be subject to revision. However, it is generally optional due to its short duration and enforceability. Instead, agreements usually include cancellation terms, which allow for the termination of a deal based on pre-established conditions.
